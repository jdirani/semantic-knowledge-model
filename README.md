# Semantic Knowledge - Model Extension

[Not yet finalized]


Based on model from:
McClelland, J. L., & Rogers, T. T. (2003). The parallel distributed processing approach to semantic cognition. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 4(4), 310.

Extends the McCelland & Rogers (2003) model to include part-whole relations wherethe parts are also represented as full concepts by the model.
e.g bird -> wings. "wings" also repreented as a concept, not just as a feature.
Does the neural  net model learn a hierarchical structure? e.g. Bird -> wings -> feathers.
